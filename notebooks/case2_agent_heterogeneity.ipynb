        "\n",
        "### Research Questions Addressed:\n",
        "- How does agent size heterogeneity affect market power distribution?\n",
        "- Do dominant agents adopt different strategies compared to smaller agents?\n",
        "- What is the impact of market concentration on overall system efficiency?\n",
        "- How does agent heterogeneity affect implicit coordination effectiveness?\n",
        "- Can smaller agents coordinate to compete against dominant players?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hypothesis:\n",
        "Market concentration will lead to strategic behavior from dominant agents, potentially reducing market efficiency, while smaller agents will need to develop more sophisticated coordination strategies to remain competitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Market Structures Tested:\n",
        "1. **Balanced Market:** Similar-sized agents with equal market power\n",
        "2. **Monopoly Market:** One dominant agent with 60% market share\n",
        "3. **Oligopoly Market:** Three medium-large agents vs. three small agents\n",
        "4. **Cooperative Market:** Community-owned cooperative with individual agents\n"
