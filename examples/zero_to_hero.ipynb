    "### 🎯 What You Can Do\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework allows researchers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Simulate interactions** between agents with distributed energy resources (DERs)\n",
    "- ✅ **Test different market clearing mechanisms** and compare their effectiveness\n",
    "- ✅ **Implement and evaluate implicit coordination strategies** for decentralized systems\n",
    "- ✅ **Analyze economic, grid stability, and resource utilization metrics**\n",
    "- ✅ **Verify the effectiveness of decentralized approaches** compared to centralized systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 What are Local Energy Markets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Energy Markets (LEMs) enable neighbors to trade energy directly with each other. Unlike traditional centralized power systems where consumers buy electricity from utility companies, LEMs allow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🏠 **Homeowners with solar panels** to sell excess electricity to neighbors\n",
    "- 🔋 **Battery owners** to store energy when cheap and sell when prices rise\n",
    "- 👥 **Consumers** to purchase locally-generated renewable energy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Why Decentralized Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional energy markets** rely on centralized control, which can:\n",
    "- ❌ Create single points of failure\n",
    "- ❌ Struggle with privacy concerns\n",
    "- ❌ Face scalability challenges in highly distributed systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning** allows agents to learn optimal strategies through experience, while **decentralized approaches** enable:\n",
    "- ✅ Increased resilience through removing single points of failure\n",
    "- ✅ Enhanced privacy by keeping sensitive data local\n",
    "- ✅ Better scalability by distributing computational load\n"
